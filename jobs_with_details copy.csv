<p><b>About the Role </b></p>
<p>Data Scientists want to spend their time exploring data, crafting the right features and optimising their models… so far so good. Production requires a lot more though. What about the data pipelines? Scaling up infrastructure based on demand? Running experiments at scale? Feature data consistency? This is where you come in as a Software Engineer for Gojek’s ML platform.</p>
<p>Most companies embed ML engineers in data science teams to solve these problems. We do things a little differently at Gojek. We build self-service products for data scientists so they don’t have to worry about deep engineering problems. Create your model and submit it to us, our platform will scale it up/down for you.</p>
<p>You will be joining a team that has already built industry-leading open-source tools. Our team invented Feast which companies like Twitter and Shopify now use. MLOps is changing fast, we’re looking for engineers who are keen to build the next big thing in MLOps.</p>

<li>Engineer high-reliability, high-performance services for sophisticated ML-driven functionality</li>
<li>Collaborate with Data Scientists to optimize ML models for high-throughput, low-latency use cases</li>
<li>Build internal tools and interfaces to improve the productivity of the team and improve the accessibility of our products</li>
